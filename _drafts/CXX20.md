In this post I'm going to cherry pick a few stand-out (for me) C++20 features, and try to explain them.

Part 1:
* Designated Initialisers
* Template parameter lists on lambdas
* `operator<=>` (the spaceship)
* String literals as template parameters

Part 2, the MAYBES:
* Extended futures
* Latches and barriers
* Ranges
* Task Blocks

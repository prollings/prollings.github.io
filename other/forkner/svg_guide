converting pdf to png to svg:
- `inkscape -f <in> -e <out>.png -d 588.5`
-- takes a pdf and exports it at 588.5dpi as a png
- open png in inkscape
- trace bitmap with threshold of 0.001
- delete bitmap and select vector object
- break apart
-- this will make any word/character with a hole get filled in
- select all parts of word and regroup
-- this will un-fill the holes
- save as inkscape svg
- then as an optimised svg in the opt_svgs folder

when two words are joined vertically:
- select the first pair of points from each word
- break path at selected node (top bar)
- do the same for the second pair of the join
-- this will result in a gap with flat edges where the join was
- select the two joined points that create the flat edge
- join selected end nodes with new segment (top bar)
- make selected nodes auto-smooth (top bar)
- do the same for the flat edge of the other word
- select word bodies (not the holes)
- move word body to bottom
- then select whole word
- join objects

unpack words into individual svgs:
- run the `sep_svg.py` script with the file number (101 - 127) as the arg
